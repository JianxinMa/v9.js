# Project Proposal: V9@Web

This project aims to develope an in-browser operating system experiment platform for educational perpose.

Below is what Jianxin Ma aimes to do.

Update: Prof. Chen suggests that debugging tools are not that easy. Therefore, some ideas below become optinal.

## Components

There are four key components in the project:
  - Simulator
  - Compiler
  - Operating System
  - Website

Below is a more detailed description of these four components.

### Simulator

- One JavaScript codebase for all:
  - ~~Simulator as a command line tool.~~ Done.
  - ~~Simulator in web browsers.~~ Done.
- Debugging support:
  - Instruction-level.
  - Source-level. At least: locate current line.
  - In-browser graphical interface.
- Hardware extensions:
  - Hard disk simulation.
  - Optional: *Symmetric multiprocessing (for xv6 Lab4).*

### Compiler

- In-browser JavaScript version:
  - ~~Request compiled result from a remote or local mini server.~~ Done.
  - Debugging support:
- Instruction-level.
  - Source-level. At least: locate current line.
- Preprocessor:
  - At least: #define. For generic data structure.

### Operating System

All ideas in this sectoin are optinal.
- *Based upon the simplified xv6 for v9.*
- *Port MIT 6.828: OSE lab 1-5 to v9.*
  - *Lab 4 involves SMP & IPC. Wow!*
  - *Lab 6 is to add a network driver. Not interesting.*
- *Port lab 7 from ucore.*
  - *Synchronization and mutual exclusion.*
- *Refactor the simplified xv6.*
  - *Generic data structure.*
  - *OOP*

### Website

- Documentation:
  - Describe the hardware architecture.
  - Background for lab assignments.
  - Source documentation via doxygen.
- Experiment Platform:
  - Editor, debugger, grader.
  - Homework submission.
  
## Personal Goal

- I will ensure:
  - A robust, extended and interactive simulator.
  - Read, edit, click, run, debug, submit. All in browsers.
- Optional: *I will do as much as I can:*
  - *Port MIT 6.828: OSE lab 1-5 to v9.*

## Related Work

This project is motivated by:
- Simulator, C compiler, simplified xv6 for v9 from swieros.

And the idea of an in-browser OS lab is pioneered by:
