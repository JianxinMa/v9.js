# Project Proposal: V9@Web

## Simulator

- One JavaScript codebase for all:
  - Simulator as a command line tool.
  - Simulator in web browsers.
- Debugging support:
  - Instruction-level.
  - Source-level. At least: locate current line.
  - In-browser graphical interface.
- Hardware extensions:
  - Hard disk simulation.
  - Symmetric multiprocessing (for xv6 Lab4).

## Compiler

- In-browser JavaScript version:
  - First try c	onverting from C via Emscripten.
  - Debugging support:
- Instruction-level.
  - Source-level. At least: locate current line.
- Preprocessor:
  - At least: #define. For generic data structure.
- Optional: function pointers?

## Operating System

- Based upon the simplified xv6 for v9.
- Port MIT 6.828: OSE lab 1-5 to v9.
  - Lab 4 involves SMP & IPC. Wow!
  - Lab 6 is to add a network driver. Not interesting.
- Port lab 7 from ucore.
  - Synchronization and mutual exclusion.
- Refactor the simplified xv6.
  - Generic data structure.
  - OOP (optional, need function pointers).

## Website

- Documentation:
  - Describe the hardware architecture.
  - Background for lab assignments.
  - Source documentation via doxygen.
- Experiment Platform:
  - Editor, debugger, grader.
  - Homework submission.
  
## Summary

- I will ensure:
  - A robust, extended and interactive simulator.
  - Read, edit, click, run, debug, submit. All in browsers.
- I will do as much as I can:
  - Port MIT 6.828: OSE lab 1-5 to v9.
