- Collaboration: add labs from the uCore group.

### Usage

The `Step` button is for single stepping. `Continue` button is for running until encountering a breakpoint. `Run` is similar to `Continue`, but ignores breakpoints. The three can be used in a mixed way. And yes, you can set breakpoints while it is running.

You can go to `Terminal` panel to interact with it while it is running.
