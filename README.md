# V9@Web

Currently working on debugging tools. See the [debugger design](doc/debugger.md) for more details.

## Usage

Here is a live [demo](https://JianxinMa.github.com/v9.js). To fire up the CPU in the browser, you will need to goto the `server` directory and use the following command to set up a mini local server at http://localhost:8080.
```bash
node server.js
```
